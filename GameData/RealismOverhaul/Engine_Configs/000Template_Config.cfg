	%description = Please put engine descriptions in the RealismOverhaul/Localization/your-lang-Engines.cfg file and then reference it here (#roTemplateConfigDesc). // Go ahead and share some of the cool things you learned while researching it. Players will be interested in the history and real-life uses of an engine, as well as info on new manufacturing techniques or concepts first tried with that engine. Be careful around acronyms; if it seems unusual or you only learned it when you started this research, either don't use it or call out what it stands for. Try and use complete sentences, and assume players will look at the stats of the engine and be able to deduce its role. Advice on any quirks of this particular engine (multiple modes to switch between with an action group, lots of subconfigs, unusual throttle or gimbal behaviors, etc.) is important to include, but, to save space, avoid generic advice, like the pros and cons of hydrolox. If possible, try to get your description short enough that users won't have to scroll, even after "From ROEngines mod Plume and sound provided by Waterfall." gets added. Proportional fonts means there isn't an exact number, but 425 characters is around the maximum that will fit.
