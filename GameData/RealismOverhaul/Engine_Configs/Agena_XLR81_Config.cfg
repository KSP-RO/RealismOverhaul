//	Notes:

//	The Agena start tanks were developed for use on the Gemini-Agena Target vehicle, to increase the number of restarts available for Agena. A pair of pressurized bladder tanks
//	were added to the XLR81, containing fuel and oxidizer. Pressurized propellants from these tanks would be used to spin up the XLR81 turbopump. Once the engine was started, 
//	propellant would be tapped off from the turbopumps to refill the tanks for the next start. This system allowed for up to 15 restarts of the XLR81 engine. Although developed
//	for GATV, the start tanks could be added to any Agena upon customer request.

//	Silicone Oil is hexamethyldisilizane

//	XLR81-BA-13 config eliminated, as it is identical to the BA-11 other than the addition of the start tanks.
//	Start tanks added ~3 kg to the overall mass of the engine (elimination of the solid starter cartridges offset weight of start tanks).
//	29 lbs (13.2 kg) additional weight for the multistart engine [2, p.2-4]
