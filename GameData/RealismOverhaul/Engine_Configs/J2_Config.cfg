//	Notes:

//	SIVB-500 was ~1100 kg heavier than SIVB-200, due to the requirement for restart. Although all J-2 engines were identical and theoretically capable of restart,
//	the engines used aboard SIVB-500s had additional accessories to facilitate restart.

//	The Continous Vent System (CVS) used hydrogen boiloff to keep the stage ullaged and helped condition the J-2. It added ~45 kg (100 lbs) to the stage mass.

//	The O2/H2 burner started prior to engine start, and preheated the helium tanks used to pressurize the stage and actuate the J-2 pneumatics. It also
//	contributed to ullage thrust. After J-2 start, heat and hydrogen bleed from the J-2 was used to maintain tank pressurization instead. Mass of the O2/H2 
//	burner system unkown. Guess 100 kg?

//	Remaining mass due to extra APS thrusters (800 lbs/363 kg), APS propellant load (1200 lbs/544 kg) and extra LH2 load (40 lbs/18 kg)

//	Engine start tank contained 7257 cui of hydrogen and 1000 cui of helium. Hydrogen was refilled by turbopump bleed after engine start, but helium could not
//	be replenished, limiting engine to 3 starts.

//	J-2 engine rated for up to 30 starts, although during AAP testing, engines tolerated over 100 starts between overhaul.

//	J-2S was instead limited by the 3 starter cartridges.

//	J-2S had idle mode of roughly 5% thrust for rapid engine cooldown and low power maneuvering. This was achieved by routing oxidizer through a special idle 
//	injector that greatly restricted flow while maintaining combustion stability at a low thrust level. 6:1 throttling was achieved by a throttle valve in the
//	combustion chamber tap-off system.
