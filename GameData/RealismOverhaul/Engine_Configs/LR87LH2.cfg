// Note: TitanC config is as of published numbers on engine performance
// for the Titan C application (simmed at 780psi, 12Ae/At). Speculative
// alternates and upgrades simmed by doubling area ratio and (for the upgrades)
// increasing efficiency and chamber pressure to later LR87 levels (5.7MPa).
// The VacuumUpgrade config uses the LR91 nozzle AR (49.2)
// Large increase in weight is from reignition equipment.

	%title = LR87-LH2
	%manufacturer = Aerojet
	%description = Aerojet developed the LR87 engine (used for the Titan series) into a liquid hydrogen/oxygen engine for prospective USAF contracts in the 1958-1960 period, at the same time Aerojet was converting the LR87 to burn Aerozine and NTO. Aerojet also proposed this engine for Saturn upper stage duties, but NASA selected the J-2 over the LR87-LH2, however, and it was canceled in 1961.
