// =================================================================================
// This is the official profile of the Realism Overhaul Mod
// =================================================================================

// TO-DO's
//
// * Add configs for all historically used life support subsystems
// * Add configs for all RO capsules with non-configurable slots
// * Configure the general "life support" part that comes with kerbalism to use in Service Modules
// * Tweak stress values to allow historical missions and nerf interplanetary flyby in a mercury capsule
// * Add RP-0 support and experiment cfgs with the 2.2 science system
// * (Long Term) Add near future life support systems to allow long term mars missions (possibly not needed?)
// * RealISRU Support?

// NOTES
//
// * Resources are added in the wrong way, Something is interfering
// * The RSS radiation profile needs to be completely remade, values are probably off
// * Shielding needs to be adjusted, it's currently using lead while it should use aluminum or polyethylene
// * Upgrades for EVA suits? Apollo doubled EVA duration from Apollo 14 and Shuttle/ISS suits improved duration again;
// * Mars suits would have Orion-like vacuum scrubbers and again, improved duration
