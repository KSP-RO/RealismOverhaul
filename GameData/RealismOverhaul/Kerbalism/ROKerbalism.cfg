// * Degeneration on all Rules
// * How much radiation is fatal?? Where are the values stored for how much a crew is exposed to?
// * Non-regenerative scrubber for EVA?
// * Pap: I think we should remove the Humidity System. It is important in RL, but hard to have abstract for our purposes causing issues for the Crew instead of systems
