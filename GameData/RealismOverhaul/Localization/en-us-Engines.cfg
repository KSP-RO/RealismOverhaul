		//		Castor-4
		#roCastor-4Title = Castor 4
		#roCastor-4Desc = The Castor 4 was developed as the second stage of the Athena H missile and first flew in 1971. It was later adapted to replace Delta's Castor 2 boosters, increasing GTO capacity from 1593 lb (723 kg) to nearly 2000 lb (900 kg). The resulting Delta 3000-series launched in 1975 and was the first to adopt a staggered booster staging sequence. Previous Delta vehicles burned their motors in a 6-3 sequence and then jettisoned all SRMs at once. The heavier and longer-burning Castor 4 required that the ground-lit motors be jettisoned immediately after depletion to reduce dead weight. Early launches used a less efficient 5-4 sequence to reduce acceleration but returned to a 6-3 sequence after Delta was strengthened in the early 80s.
		//		Castor-4A

		//		LMAE
		#roLMAETitle = Lunar Module Ascent Engine (LMAE)
		#roLMAEDesc = A pressure-fed engine used for the ascent module of the Apollo lunar lander.
		//		LMDE
		#roLMDETitle = Lunar Module Descent Engine (LMDE)
		#roLMDEDesc = A deeply throttleable pressure-fed engine used for the descent module of the Apollo lunar lander using storable propellants. The version used on J-class missions had slightly higher specific impulse, which, along with other changes, gave enough payload capacity for the rover and other equipment. A later variant (TR-201) was used on Delta as an upper stage engine (on Delta P series); this was a low-cost model with more restarts (4 instead of 2) and slightly higher thrust but lower efficiency and no throttling capability.
		//		LR79
		#roLR79Title = LR79
		#roLR79Desc = A long-lasting US kerolox gas-generator booster engine. The same components and broadly the same performance as the LR89, the LR79 (also known as S-3D in Jupiter / Juno II) powered the Jupiter, Thor, and Thor-Delta (Delta) rockets.
		//		LR83
		#roLR83Title = LR83
		#roLR83Desc = A LOX/Kerosene gas generator engine designed for booster applications. Three gimbaled engines would have been used in the Navaho booster.
		//		LR87
		#roLR87Title = LR87
		#roLR87Desc = Used in the first stage of the Titan rocket family, the LR87 is composed of two engines with separate turbomachinery integrated into one unit. The version used on Titan I burned kerosene and liquid oxygen, while Titan II through Titan IV burned storable propellants. A modified version burning liquid hydrogen was developed for the upper stages of Saturn V and Saturn IB, but the J-2 was selected instead.
		//		LR87LH2
		#roLR87LH2Title = LR87-LH2
		#roLR87LH2Desc = Aerojet developed the LR87 engine (used for the Titan series) into a liquid hydrogen/oxygen engine for prospective USAF contracts in the 1958-1960 period, at the same time Aerojet was converting the LR87 to burn Aerozine and NTO. Aerojet also proposed this engine for Saturn upper stage duties, but NASA selected the J-2 over the LR87-LH2 and it was canceled in 1961.
		//		LR89
		#roLR89Title = LR43/LR89
		#roLR89Desc = Beginning its life as the etholox powered XLR43-NA-3, this was the first US engine to use tubular-wall construction for its combustion chamber. It served as the basis for the early orbital engines of the US, with its lineage carrying on all the way to the 21st century. The LR43 was converted to run on kerosene for Atlas and was later renamed LR89, and the LR79 derivative powered Thor. Late model LR89s were upgraded with RS-27 components for higher efficiency, whereas the RS-27 itself was used on Delta by that point. LR89 configs are comparable to similar-era -79 configs, since they were the same engine underneath.
		//		LR91
		#roLR91Title = LR91
		#roLR91Desc = The LR91 powered the second stage of Titan launchers. Exhaust from the gas generator provided roll control.
		//		LR101

		#roLR101Desc = A pump or pressure-fed kerolox vernier engine. Used for attitude control and final velocity adjustment in the MA-x system (2x LR89 + LR105 + 2x LR101) on Atlas, and MB-x system (LR79 or RS-27 + 2xLR101) on Thor-Able, Thor-Agena, Thor-Delta, and Delta.
		//		LR105
		#roLR105Title = LR105
		#roLR105Desc = Kerolox gas-generator sustainer engine used in the Atlas launch vehicle. It, like the Atlas's booster engines (LR89s), is lit on the ground, but a bit over 2 minutes into flight the boosters are dropped and the Atlas core continues to orbit under the power of the sustainer engine (and the verniers for roll control and final adjustment). The final configuration of the LR105 (like the LR89) uses RS-27 components for increased performance. As a sustainer engine, the LR105 has relatively poor sea level specific impulse compared to most boosters, but somewhat better vacuum specific impulse--though the difference in both is nowhere near as pronounced as when comparing a booster to an upper stage engine.
		//		LR129
		#roLR129Title = LR129
		#roLR129Desc = Staged combustion sustainer engine developed for the USAF ISINGLASS spaceplane. After the ISINGLASS project was cancelled, it was adapted by P&W for their SSME proposal.

		//		LRBE
		#roLRBETitle = LRBE
		#roLRBEDesc = Developed from the RS-25 SSME, the Liquid Rocket Booster Engine (LRBE) was a design concept for a liquid fueled Space Shuttle booster. Methane was chosen as a fuel, which increased density and thrust while still allowing fuel-rich staged combustion.

		#roNAA75_110Title = NAA-75-110 A-Series
		#roNAA75_110Desc = The power plant of the PGM-11 Redstone Short Range Ballistic Missile (SRBM). Originally designed for Ethanol/LOX (A-6) it was later adapted to use Hydyne/LOX for approximately 6% more performance in Jupiter-C / Juno I. When the Redstone was adapted from the Jupiter-C for manned use under the Project Mercury (Mercury-Redstone Launch Vehicle - MRLV), the A-7 was used with the original Ethalox mixture, accepting a slightly lower performance for the lack of toxicity. Thrust vector control was provided by carbon thrust vanes and additional attitude control was provided by actuating fins placed in the guidance section.
		//		NERVA
		#roNERVATitle = NERVA I
		#roNERVADesc = A 1970s low TWR vacuum engine, the NERVA (Nuclear Engine for Rocket Vehicle Applications) is designed for orbital tugs and large rocket upper stages.

		#roRD58Desc = World's first closed-cycle kerolox vacuum engine. The S1.5400 served as an R-7 upper stage and the RD-58 upgrade was used as an upper stage / OMS for many Soviet and Russian vehicles (Proton, N1, Zenit, Buran...). The S1.5400 was designed for the Blok L stage, the final stage for the Molniya configuration of the R-7, used to launch communication satellites and interplanetary probes. Unlike prior upper stages, it was restartable (this was needed to perform apogee kicks to place Molniya satellites in their final orbits). It was given the industry designation 11D33. An upgraded version, termed 11D33M, had slightly improved performance. The RD-58 is a derivative of the 11D33M engine with higher performance (industry designation 11D58); it has been used on many Russian launchers and is still in use today on Proton and Zenit. In comparison to hydrolox upper stages, kerolox ones do not suffer boiloff as badly and need far less volume (kerosene being far denser than liquid hydrogen), but have much lower specific impulse.
