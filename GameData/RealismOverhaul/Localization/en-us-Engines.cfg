		//		LPNTR
		#roLPNTRTitle = Low-Pressure NTR
		#roLPNTRDesc = The low-pressure NTR is a proposal for a higher performance NTR, relying on hydrogen dissociation. By decreasing the chamber pressure of an NTR to near atmospheric pressure, it is possible to trigger dissociation of diatomic hydrogen into monatomic hydrogen, greatly increasing specific impulse. This low pressure also allows for extremely lightweight construction, allowing for an acceptable TWR despite the low mass flow. The LPNTR is also extremely simple, requiring no pumps, and self-regulating using hydrogen as a moderator, although it also lacks a gimbal.
		//		LR79

		//		LR87LH2
		#roLR87LH2Title = LR87-LH2
		#roLR87LH2Desc = Aerojet developed the LR87 engine (used for the Titan series) into a liquid hydrogen/oxygen engine for prospective USAF contracts in the 1958-1960 period, at the same time Aerojet was converting the LR87 to burn Aerozine and NTO.

		//		LR89
		#roLR89Title = LR43/LR89
		#roLR89Desc = Beginning its life as the etholox-powered XLR43-NA-3, this was the first US engine to use tubular-wall construction for its combustion chamber. It served as the basis for early orbital US engines, with its lineage stretching to the 21st century. The LR43 was converted to run on kerosene for Atlas and was later renamed LR89, and the LR79 derivative powered Thor. Later LR89s used RS-27 components for higher efficiency, whereas the RS-27 itself was used on Delta by that point. LR89 configs are comparable to similar-era -79 configs, since they were the same engine underneath.
		//		LR91
		#roLR91Title = LR91
		#roLR91Desc = The LR91 powered the second stage of Titan launchers. Exhaust from the gas generator provided roll control.
		//		LR101

		//		LR105
		#roLR105Title = LR105
		#roLR105Desc = A kerolox gas-generator sustainer engine used in the Atlas launch vehicle. It, like the Atlas's booster engines (LR89s), is lit on the ground, but after a bit over 2 minutes the boosters are dropped and Atlas continues to orbit under the power of the LR105 (with the verniers for roll control and final adjustment). The final configuration of the LR105 (like the LR89) uses RS-27 components for better performance. As a sustainer, the LR105 has sea level and vacuum efficiencies somewhere between a booster and an upper stage engine.
		//		LR129
		#roLR129Title = LR129
		#roLR129Desc = A staged combustion sustainer engine developed for the USAF ISINGLASS spaceplane. After the ISINGLASS project was cancelled, it was adapted by P&W for their SSME proposal.

		//		LRBE
		#roLRBETitle = LRBE
		#roLRBEDesc = Developed from the RS-25 SSME, the Liquid Rocket Booster Engine (LRBE) was a design concept for a liquid fueled Space Shuttle booster. Methane was chosen as a fuel, which increased density and thrust while still allowing fuel-rich staged combustion.
		//		LRC LNTR
		#roLRCLNTRTitle = Lewis Research Center LNTR
		#roLRCLNTRDesc = A "radiator" liquid core nuclear thermal rocket developed by Lewis Research Center. Rather than bubbling hydrogen through the reactor core, it is used to regeneratively cool the reactor walls, then flow through the middle of the reactor to be heated by radiation. Although this is less efficient than a "bubbler" reactor, the reduced interaction with the reactor core allows for much higher mass flow rates without excessive fuel loss, resulting in a higher TWR. The simpler core design also means it can be reloaded with fuel on-orbit (requires Near Future Electrical).

		#roM1Title = M-1
		#roM1Desc = The massive M-1 engine was the largest and most powerful hydrolox engine ever designed and individual components have been tested. It was generally designed as an upper stage engine, but first stage designs with expanding nozzles were also worked on.

		//		RD0410MID
		#roRD0410MIDTitle = RD-0410
		#roRD0410MIDDesc = RD-0410 was a Soviet nuclear thermal rocket engine developed from 1965 through the 1994 using liquid hydrogen propellant. The engine was ground-tested at the Semipalatinsk Test Site, and its use was incorporated in the Kurchatov Mars 1994 manned mission proposal. Its moderator and fuel are quite different from the US designs and Metal Carbide (MC) versions of the fuel are rumoured to have reach as high as 3500K without melting in the early 1990's. Use of Heptane to reduce hydrogen corrosion of the carbides was critical to function (~1%). First run tests occurred in 1985. Some Russian sources list it as dual mode using not only Hydrogen but also liquid Methane without additives. During the SNTP program the US tried to acquire MC fuels from Russian sources but planned purchases fell through. This engine is very heavily built compared to US designs and incorporates a four lobed spiral fuel rod to eliminate risk of fuel being ejected if the rods shattered. This design uses a short regeneratively cooled nozzle and is intended as an upper stage. Design stats Nozzle Ae=46   Chamber Temp=3000   Ideal ISP=972  Reactor Power=173MW(th)  TWR=1.73   Chamber Pressure=4000kPa   Ignitions =10   Tonnage including integral shadow shield:2tons.  In Methane mode the nozzle is slightly expanded by 12cm length and slightly enlarged. Nozzle Ae=46   Chamber Temp=3000   Ideal ISP=467  Reactor Power=173MW(th)  TWR=3.56   Chamber Pressure=4800kPa   Ignitions =10   Tonnage including integral shadow shield:2tons

Using the same advanced Metal Carbide (MC) fuels and spiral fuel rods as the RD-0410, it achieves good performance for it's size. Unlike the RD-0410, no test articles were ever built, as the failure of the N1 and cancellation of the UR-700 meant there would be no launch vehicle large enough to use it. It never progressed past the study stage, and much of it's performance is speculative.

		//		RD600
		#roRD600Title = RD-600 Open Cycle Gas Core Atomic Rocket Motor
		#roRD600Desc = A Soviet magnetic confinment open cycle gas core nuclear rocket. After a few experiments with solid-core nuclear thermal rockets, Glushko ordered development transferred to other design bureaus due to low performance, and instead focused on gas core nuclear rockets.

		#roR79Title = R-79 Turbofan
		#roR79Desc = A 1980s afterburning turbofan, designed for the Yak-41. It was equipped with an engine gimbal system that allowed the nozzle to rotate 95 degrees, to support vertical flight, and was the first engine of this type equipped with an afterburner, allowing the Yak-41 to achieve supersonic flight. It powered the Yak-141/41, and was proposed to power the Su-47 with the thrust vectoring system removed.
		//		RB162
		#roRB162Title = RB.162 Turbojet
		#roRB162x2Title = 2x RB.162 Turbojet
		#roRB162Desc = The RB.162 was a lightweight turbojet, designed to be used as a liftjet for VTOL aircraft. It utilized fiberglass and plastic extensively in it's construction to reduce weight as much as possible, resulting in a low lifetime but very high thrust-to-weight ratio. It was used as a liftjet on the Do-31, Mirage IIIV, and VAK 191B, and as a booster engine on the Trident 3B to improve takeoff performance.
		//		RD-9
		#roRD9Title = RD-9 Turbojet
		#roRD9Desc = An early 50s turbojet. Developed as a scaled down Mikulin AM-3, the RD-9 was designed for fighter aircraft and powered the Yak-25, 26, 27, 28, and MiG-19. It was license-built in China as the WP-6, where it powered the JJ-6, J/F-6, Q/A-5, and J-12.
		//		RD-36
		#roRD36Title = RD-36 Turbojet
		#roRD36Desc = The RD-36 was a 1970s turbojet, developed to power the Tu-144. The RD-36 replaced the underperforming NK-144 engines, allowing the Tu-144 to achieve its intended range. Ultimately, the Tu-144 was taken out of service shortly after being upgraded due to costs. The RD-36 powered the Tu-144D and M-17.
		//		RD-41
		#roRD41Title = RD-41 Turbojet
		#roRD41x2Title = 2x RD-41 Turbojet
		#roRD41Desc = The RD-41 was a lightweight turbojet, designed as an improved version of the RD-36 liftjet for the Yak-141/41M. It was provided with a gimballing engine mount, allowing for 12.5 degrees of deflection to improve stability while hovering. Used as the liftjet on the Yak-141/41M.
		//		RD-012
		#roRD012Title = RD-012 Ramjet
		#roRD012Desc = The RD-012 was a supersonic ramjet, designed to power the La-350 Burya cruise missile up to Mach 3.1.
		//		RJ43
		#roRJ43Title = RJ43 Ramjet
		#roRJ43Desc = The RJ43 was a supersonic ramjet, designed to power the CIM-10 Bomarc surface to air missile at speeds up to Mach 3. It was also used on the X-7 and XQ-5/AQM-60 target drone, and was modified to power the D-21 up to speeds over Mach 3.3.
		//		RJ47
		#roRJ47Title = RJ47 Ramjet
		#roRJ47Desc = The RJ47 was a supersonic ramjet, designed to power the SM-64 Navaho cruise missile up to Mach 2.75.
		//		RJ55
		#roRJ55Title = RJ55/J67 Combined Cycle Ramjet
		#roRJ55Desc = The RJ55 was a combined cycle ramjet, mated to a J67. At low speeds, the RJ55 functioned as an afterburner for the J67 turbojet, but at mach 2.24 the turbojet would be shut down and the RJ55 would power the aircraft up to Mach 3. Designed for the XF-103, but difficuties with the J67 turbojet meant the prototype never flew under it's own power.
		//		RJ59
		#roRJ59Title = RJ59 Ramjet
		#roRJ59Desc = The RJ59 was a supersonic ramjet, designed to power the Convair Super Hustler. Although the Super Hustler was cancelled, the RJ59 was fitted to the X-7 for testing, where it was able to achieve speeds over Mach 4.
		//		Sapphire
		#roSapphireTitle = Sapphire Turbojet
		#roSapphireDesc = An early 1950s turbojet. Derived from the MetroVick F.2, the first axial-flow jet developed in Britain, the Sapphire powered the Hawker Hunter, Handley Page Victor, and Gloster Javelin.
		//		VK-1
		#roVK1Title = VK-1 Turbojet
		#roVK1Desc = A Soviet-built derivative of the Nene used in many early Soviet jet aircraft, including the MiG-15, MiG-17, Tu-14, and Il-28.
		//		Welland
		#roWellandTitle = Welland Turbojet
		#roWellandDesc = The Welland was an early 1940s turbojet, developed from Frank Whittle's original jet engine, the W.1. It was used on the Meteor F.1, but was quickly replaced by later, more powerful jet engines.
		//		WS-10
		#roWS10Title = WS-10 Low-Bypass Turbofan
		#roWS10Desc = The WS-10 is a modern low-bypass afterburning turbofan, and the first successful Chinese turbofan design. Developed from the earlier experimental WS-6 turbofan, the WS-10 was designed to replace the Russian AL-31 engines used in some Chinese aircraft. The WS-10 powers the J-8II, J-10B/C, J-11B, J-15, J-16, and J-20/A.
