		//		BNTR
		#roBNTRTitle = Bimodal NTR
		#roBNTRDesc = Low thrust pump-fed expander nuclear engine. Evolved from the original NERVA design, the Bimodal NTR, instead of wasting precious propellant mass on cooling the engine reactor, uses a Brayton cycle electricity generator unit to convert the waste thermal energy into useful electrical power.

		#roCastor-2Desc = A derivative of the Castor 1 motor, the Castor 2 featured higher specific impulse and propellant load, a lower dry mass fraction, and a longer burn time. It was used as strap-on booster starting with Delta E and in all but the early Scouts. Burn time 39s.
		//		Castor-4
		#roCastor-4Title = Castor 4
		#roCastor-4Desc = The Castor 4 was developed as the second stage of the Athena H missile and first flew in 1971. It was later adapted to replace Delta's Castor 2 boosters, increasing GTO capacity from 1593 lb (723 kg) to nearly 2000 lb (900 kg). The resulting Delta 3000-series launched in 1975 and was the first to adopt a staggered booster staging sequence. Previous Delta vehicles burned their motors in a 6-3 sequence and then jettisoned all SRMs at once. The heavier and longer-burning Castor 4 required that the ground-lit motors be jettisoned immediately after depletion to reduce dead weight. Early launches used a less efficient 5-4 sequence to reduce acceleration but returned to a 6-3 sequence after Delta was strengthened in the early 80s.

It consists of the single nozzle S5.60 main engine and the dual nozzle S5.35 backup engine. If the main engine fails, the backup one will assume its position.
		//		KTDU417
		#roKTDU417Title = KTDU-417
		#roKTDU417Desc = The landing engine for Luna 15-24. The main gas generator engine was used for orbital manuevering and descent, and then switched over to a secondary pressurefed engine for terminal descent. Use an action group to toggle between the main and secondary engines quickly to make landing easier.
		//		KTDU425A
		#roKTDU425ATitle = KTDU-425
		#roKTDU425ADesc = A Soviet gas generator hypergolic vacuum engine. Designed for use in the propulsion systems of the Mars and Venera 3MV, 4MV and 5MV spacecraft buses.
		//		KVD1
		#roKVD1Title = RD-56/KVD-1/CE-7.5
		#roKVD1Desc = A staged combustion hydrolox upper stage engine intended for use on the N-1M and considered for use on Proton and Angara, eventually licensed to India for its GSLV MkI and MkII. Later versions were developed by India for domestic use on the as the CE-7.5. The main engine bell is fixed in place and two verniers are used to provide combined pitch-yaw-roll control; this leads to lower control authority than on stages where the main engine can gimbal. This engine runs with a somewhat higher than average O/F ratio, resulting in a denser than average hydrolox stage.
		//L
		//		LE3
		#roLE3Title = LE-3
		#roLE3Desc = A small pressure-fed hypergolic engine. Developed with the assistance of Rocketdyne to power the upper stage of the N-I rocket.
		//		LE5
		#roLE5Title = LE-5
		#roLE5Desc = The LE-5 was a gas generator hydrolox engine and the first natively developed Japanese hydrolox engine, designed for use on the second stage of the H-1 launch vehicle. It was then completely redesigned into the world's first expander bleed cycle engine for use on the H-II. It has gone through several evolutions since, being used on the H-IIA, H-IIB, and planned for the H-3.
		//		LE7
		#roLE7Title = LE-7
		#roLE7Desc = A fuel-rich staged combustion engine used on the core stage of H-II series launchers. The original LE-7 was replaced by the LE-7A, which sacrificed some performance in favor of reduced cost and better reliability.
		//		LE9
		#roLE9Title = LE-9
		#roLE9Desc = An expander-bleed cycle booster engine, developed for the Japanese H-3 launch vehicle. The use of an expander-bleed cycle makes the engine much cheaper than it's staged combustion predecessor, the LE-7.
		//		LEROS1b
		#roLEROS1bTitle = LEROS-1b (635N)
		#roLEROS1bDesc = LEROS is a family of chemical rocket engines manufactured by Moog-ISP. LEROS engines have been used as primary apogee engines for telecommunications satellites such as the Lockheed Martin A2100 as well as deep space missions such as Juno.
		//		LEROS4
		#roLEROS4Title = LEROS-4 (1100N)
		#roLEROS4Desc = The LEROS 4 High Thrust Apogee Engine is an ESA funded 1100 N engine undergoing development by Moog. It will support the agency's future interplanetary missions by reducing the mass of spacecraft propellant required for orbit insertion manoeuvres, allowing more scientific payload to be carried.
		//		LMAE
		#roLMAETitle = Lunar Module Ascent Engine (LMAE)
		#roLMAEDesc = A pressure-fed engine used for the ascent module of the Apollo lunar lander.
		//		LMDE
		#roLMDETitle = Lunar Module Descent Engine (LMDE)
		#roLMDEDesc = A deeply throttleable pressure-fed engine used for the descent module of the Apollo lunar lander using storable propellants. The version used on J-class missions had slightly higher specific impulse, which, along with other changes, gave enough payload capacity for the rover and other equipment. A later variant (TR-201) was used on Delta as an upper stage engine (on Delta P series); this was a low-cost model with more restarts (4 instead of 2) and slightly higher thrust but lower efficiency and no throttling capability.
		//		LPNTR
		#roLPNTRTitle = Low-Pressure NTR
		#roLPNTRDesc = The low pressure NTR is a proposal for a higher performance NTR, relying on hydrogen dissociation. By decreasing the chamber pressure of an NTR to near atmospheric pressure, it is possible to trigger dissociation of diatomic hydrogen into monatomic hydrogen, greatly increasing specific impulse. This low pressure also allows for extremely lightweight construction, allowing for an acceptable TWR despite the low mass flow. The LPNTR is also extremely simple, requiring no pumps, and self-regulating using hydrogen as a moderator, although it also lacks a gimbal.
		//		LR79
		#roLR79Title = LR79
		#roLR79Desc = A long-lasting US kerolox gas-generator booster engine. The same components and broadly the same performance as the LR89, the LR79 (also known as S-3D in Jupiter / Juno II) powered the Jupiter, Thor, and Thor-Delta (Delta) rockets.
		//		LR83
		#roLR83Title = LR83
		#roLR83Desc = A LOX/Kerosene gas generator engine designed for booster applications. Three gimbaled engines would have been used in the Navaho booster.
		//		LR87
		#roLR87Title = LR87
		#roLR87Desc = Used in the first stage of the Titan rocket family, the LR87 is composed of two engines with separate turbomachinery integrated into one unit. The version used on Titan I burned kerosene and liquid oxygen, while Titan II through Titan IV burned storable propellants. A modified version burning liquid hydrogen was developed for the upper stages of Saturn V and Saturn IB, but the J-2 was selected instead.
		//		LR87LH2
		#roLR87LH2Title = LR87-LH2
		#roLR87LH2Desc = Aerojet developed the LR87 engine (used for the Titan series) into a liquid hydrogen/oxygen engine for prospective USAF contracts in the 1958-1960 period, at the same time Aerojet was converting the LR87 to burn Aerozine and NTO. Aerojet also proposed this engine for Saturn upper stage duties, but NASA selected the J-2 over the LR87-LH2 and it was canceled in 1961.
		//		LR89
		#roLR89Title = LR43/LR89
		#roLR89Desc = Beginning its life as the etholox powered XLR43-NA-3, this was the first US engine to use tubular-wall construction for its combustion chamber. It served as the basis for the early orbital engines of the US, with its lineage carrying on all the way to the 21st century. The LR43 was converted to run on kerosene for Atlas and was later renamed LR89, and the LR79 derivative powered Thor. Late model LR89s were upgraded with RS-27 components for higher efficiency, whereas the RS-27 itself was used on Delta by that point. LR89 configs are comparable to similar-era -79 configs, since they were the same engine underneath.
		//		LR91
		#roLR91Title = LR91
		#roLR91Desc = The LR91 powered the second stage of Titan launchers. Exhaust from the gas generator provided roll control.
		//		LR101
		#roLR101Title = LR101
		#roLR101Desc = A pump or pressure-fed kerolox vernier engine. Used for attitude control and final velocity adjustment in the MA-x system (2x LR89 + LR105 + 2x LR101) on Atlas, and MB-x system (LR79 or RS-27 + 2xLR101) on Thor-Able, Thor-Agena, Thor-Delta, and Delta.
		//		LR105
		#roLR105Title = LR105
		#roLR105Desc = Kerolox gas-generator sustainer engine used in the Atlas launch vehicle. It, like the Atlas's booster engines (LR89s), is lit on the ground, but a bit over 2 minutes into flight the boosters are dropped and the Atlas core continues to orbit under the power of the sustainer engine (and the verniers for roll control and final adjustment). The final configuration of the LR105 (like the LR89) uses RS-27 components for increased performance. As a sustainer engine, the LR105 has relatively poor sea level specific impulse compared to most boosters, but somewhat better vacuum specific impulse--though the difference in both is nowhere near as pronounced as when comparing a booster to an upper stage engine.
		//		LR129
		#roLR129Title = LR129
		#roLR129Desc = Staged combustion sustainer engine developed for the USAF ISINGLASS spaceplane. After the ISINGLASS project was cancelled, it was adapted by P&W for their SSME proposal. It utilized staged combustion, mixture control, and extendable nozzles to allow for versitility and high performance.
		//		LRBE
		#roLRBETitle = LRBE
		#roLRBEDesc = Developed from the RS-25 SSME, the Liquid Rocket Booster Engine (LRBE) was a design concept for a liquid fueled Space Shuttle booster. Methane was chosen as a fuel, which increased density and thrust while still allowing fuel-rich staged combustion.
		//		LRC LNTR
		#roLRCLNTRTitle = Lewis Research Center LNTR
		#roLRCLNTRDesc = A "radiator" liquid core nuclear thermal rocket developed by Lewis Research Center. Rather than bubbling hydrogen through the reactor core, it is used to regeneratively cool the reactor walls, then flow through the middle of the reactor to be heated by radiation. Although this is less efficient than a "bubbler" reactor, the reduced interaction with the reactor core allows for much higher mass flow rates without excessive fuel loss, resulting in a higher TWR. The simpler core design also means it can be reloaded with fuel on-orbit (requires Near Future Electrical).
		//M
		//		M1
		#roM1Title = M-1
		#roM1Desc = The massive M-1 engine was the largest and most powerful hydrolox engine ever designed. Individual components have been tested. Generally designed as an upper stage engine, first stages designs with expanding nozzles were also worked on.
		//		M10
		#roM10Title = M10
		#roM10Desc = Italian expander cycle methalox upper stage engine. Originally developed as a derivative of the RD-0146 in collarboration with KBKhA, sanctions levied against Russia in 2014 forced Avio to continue the development alone. The engine is intended to be used as the third stage of the new Vega-E launch vehicle, with it's first flight planned for 2026.
		//		M55
		#roM55Title = M55 (Minuteman)

		#roMR-80BTitle = MR-80B (MLE)
		#roMR-80BDesc = The Mars Landing Engine (MLE) is a derivative of the highly successful MR-80 engine used for the two Viking missions to Mars in 1976. Eight of these engines were used on the sky-crane which landed the Curiosity Rover on the martian surface.
		//N
		//		NAA75_110
		#roNAA75_110Title = NAA-75-110 A-Series
		#roNAA75_110Desc = The power plant of the PGM-11 Redstone Short Range Ballistic Missile (SRBM). Originally designed for Ethanol/LOX (A-6) it was later adapted to use Hydyne/LOX for approximately 6% more performance in Jupiter-C / Juno I. When the Redstone was adapted from the Jupiter-C for manned use under the Project Mercury (Mercury-Redstone Launch Vehicle - MRLV), the A-7 was used with the original Ethalox mixture, accepting a slightly lower performance for the lack of toxicity. Thrust vector control was provided by carbon thrust vanes and additional attitude control was provided by actuating fins placed in the guidance section.
		//		NERVA
		#roNERVATitle = NERVA I
		#roNERVADesc = A 1970s low TWR vacuum engine, the NERVA (Nuclear Engine for Rocket Vehicle Applications) is designed for orbital tugs and large rocket upper stages.

		#roNERVA_NRXTitle = NERVA NRX
		//		NERVA_XE
		#roNERVA_XETitle = Nerva XE-Prime
		#roNERVA_XEDesc = The "Nerva XE" series is a 1550MW reactor. A full flight test prototype originally based on the KIWI B4E. Its core is capable of starting up sixty times.  An integral Tungsten Boron composite shield is included and the whole assembly is regeneratively cooled. A secondary circuit runs the shut down gasses through a small heat engine to minimize fuel loss and provide basic alternator power. This engine should be mounted three to six meters from the closest fuel tank.  Fuel should shield any crew and crew positions when running should be eight to ten meters from the engine. Additional shielding such as a water tank or high density fuel can somewhat reduce this amount. This rocket represents the beginnings of a more powerful and capable series of rocket. This version features a fixed regeneratively cooled nozzle with a 100:1 expansion ratio. Nozzle Ae=100   Chamber Temp=2500   Ideal ISP=945  Reactor Power=1163MW(th)  TWR=2.34   Chamber Pressure=3806kPa   Ignitions =60   Tonnage including integral shadow shield: 10.38tons

		#roNK33Desc = The NK-15 and NK-33 were originally built in the 1960s/early 1970s for the Soviet N1 and then N1F rocket, respectively. Though the N1F was scrapped, the engines survived. Aerojet acquired several NK-33 engines in the 1990s and refurbished them as AJ26-62 engines for Orbital Science's Antares launch vehicle. Modifications made by Aerojet included increasing rated thrust and equipping the engines to support gimballing.

		//		Princeton LNTR
		#roPrincetonLNTRTitle = Princeton LNTR
		#roPrincetonLNTRDesc = A "Bubbler" liquid core nuclear thermal rocket. Hydrogen gas is bubbled through the liquid core of the reactor, resulting in extremely efficient heat transfer and high performance. Unfortunately, unexpected behavior in the hydrogen gas bubbles resulted in large amounts of fuel being lost from the reactor, and temperature and propellant flow had to be reduced, decreasing performance. A later redesign with a different fuel alloy allowed some performance to be restored.
		//Q

		//		R4D11
		#roR4D11Title = R-4D
		#roR4D11Desc = A 490 N bipropellant thruster as found in the propulsion system of the ESA ATV and the Orion MPCV Service Module.

		#roR103Desc = A post-war Russian version of the German Taifun anti-aircraft barrage rocket booster. Developed and tested in 1947-1951 but abandoned in favor of the R-110. A cluster of 8 of these rockets formed the first stage of the MR-1 sounding rocket. Length without payload - 1.36 meters. 
		//		RangerRetro
		#roRangerRetroTitle = MC-4-610
		#roRangerRetroDesc = A 225 N Hydrazine thruster, used on all Ranger and early Mariner spacecraft for midcourse corrections. Since reliable Hydrazine catalysts had not yet been developed, the engines were only capable of two starts.

		#roRaptorDesc = The Raptor is a methalox full-flow staged combustion engine designed for both Starship & the Super Heavy Launch Vehicle. The Super Heavy first stage uses 31 sea-level optimized engines, and Starship uses 3 sea-level engines and 3 vacuum engines.
		//		RD1
		#roRD1Title = RD-1
		#roRD1Desc = A four-chamber nitric acid and kerosene engine developed by Glushko during WW2. It was used in various rocket powered aircraft proposals, and tested extensivley in the Pe-2RD, a Pe-2 bomber with an RD-1 installed in the fuselage, but abandoned after WW2, as jet engines proved to be more reliable for high performance aircraft.
		//		RD8
		#roRD8Title = RD-8
		#roRD8Desc = The RD-8 is a four-chamber, staged combustion, vacuum kerolox vernier engine. It is used on the second stage of the Zenit launch vehicle family for two-axis attitude control.
		//		RD57
		#roRD57Title = RD-57
		#roRD57Desc = A 1970s low TWR staged combustion hydrolox upper stage engine intended for use on the N-1/N-1M. A later version designated RD-57M had am extendable nozzle and was intended for the Vulkan and Energia-M rockets. The engine was marketed by Aerojet in the 1990s under the designation D-57 for use on an SSTO demonstrator.
		//		RD58
		#roRD58Title = S1.5400/RD-58 Series
		#roRD58Desc = World's first closed-cycle kerolox vacuum engine. The S1.5400 served as an R-7 upper stage and the RD-58 upgrade was used as an upper stage / OMS for many Soviet and Russian vehicles (Proton, N1, Zenit, Buran...). The S1.5400 was designed for the Blok L stage, the final stage for the Molniya configuration of the R-7, used to launch communication satellites and interplanetary probes. Unlike prior upper stages, it was restartable (this was needed to perform apogee kicks to place Molniya satellites in their final orbits). It was given the industry designation 11D33. An upgraded version, termed 11D33M, had slightly improved performance. The RD-58 is a derivative of the 11D33M engine with higher performance (industry designation 11D58); it has been used on many Russian launchers and is still in use today on Proton and Zenit. In comparison to hydrolox upper stages, kerolox ones do not suffer boiloff as badly and need far less volume (kerosene being far denser than liquid hydrogen), but have much lower specific impulse.
		//		RD100
		#roRD100Title = RD-100
		#roRD100Desc = The RD-100 engine series were the first large scale ethalox Russian engines ever developed and fired. The original RD-100 engine was a 1:1 copy of the German Model 39 engine (used on the A-4 ballistic missile), with later variants (RD-101 and RD-103/M) featuring ever increasing performance to satisfy the needs of the larger R-2 and R-5 IRBMs.

Powers the R-7 family core through a very long (roughly) five minute burn that starts on the pad alongside the boosters.
		//		RD109
		#roRD109Title = RD-109/119
		#roRD109Desc = A Soviet high performance semi-cryogenic upper stage engine. Originally developed as an upper stage for the R-7, it was never used due to Korolev's refusal to use toxic propellants. It was later adapted for the Kosmos-2 Launch Vehicle, which needed a high performance upper stage due to the low performance of its R-12 first stage.
		//		RD0110
		#roRD0110Title = RD-0107/0110
		#roRD0110Desc = An upper stage kerolox engine designed for the R-9 ICBM, and later used on the Molniya, Voskhod and Soyuz launchers.

		//		RD111
		#roRD111Title = RD-111
		#roRD111Desc = First stage engine for the R-9 ICBM. Derived from the RD-107/108 engines of the R-7, the RD-111 was intended to provide a much quicker reaction time than the R-7. Although still using cryogenic liquid oxygen, it could be fuelled and launched in under 20 minutes. This, combined with its high performance, meant it was the last cryogenic ICBM to leave service.
