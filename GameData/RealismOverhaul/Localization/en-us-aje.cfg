		//		J48-P-5
		#roRO-J48Title = J48-P-5 Turbojet
		#roRO-J48Desc = Also known as the Rolls-Royce Tay. Essentially an enlarged Nene, the Tay was abandoned by Rolls-Royce in favor of the Avon. However, Pratt & Whitney was able to acquire the design, and produced it as the J48. It was used in the F9F-5 Panther, F9F-6/8 Cougar, F-94C Starfire, and YF-93. This is the -5, with afterburner, as used in the F-94C. Available 1950. 38.9 kN wet, 28.2 kN dry. 4.4 OPR, SFC 1.16 lb/lbf-hr static. Temperature limit Mach 1.
		
		//		J57-P-8
		#roRO-J57P8Title = J57-P-8 Turbojet
		#roRO-J57P8Desc = Early 50s turbojet. The J57 was a workhorse, designed in the early 1950s and powering the B-52, most of the Century Series fighters, and even the U-2. This represents an early model, the -8, which powered the F4D Skyray/F5D Skylancer. Available 1951. 64.5kN wet, 45.3kN dry. OPR 11.9, SFC 0.90/2.1 lb/lbf-hr static. Temperature limit Mach 1.5.
		
		//		Model 304-2
		#roRO-model304Title = Model 304-2 Turbojet
		#roRO-model304Desc = Late 50s turbojet. Based on the Pratt & Whitney J57, the Model 304-2 was a liquid-hydrogen fueled turbojet, designed for project SUNTAN, a high performance replacement for the U-2 spyplane. The project required the development of large-scale Liquid Hydrogen production and handling techniques, at the cost of hundreds of millions of dollars, but the results were impressive. Pratt & Whitney were able to convert various jet engines to hydrogen power, where they showed incredible stability and efficiency. This information, along with many of the engineers involved in the project, were later transferred to working on the Pratt & Whitney RL-10, where the information gained proved invaluable. The Model 304 and project SUNTAN, however, were ultimately cancelled, as the conventionally fueled A-12/SR-71 was showing much greater promise. This represents the Model 304-2, the most advanced design developed before the cancellation of the project. Available 1959. 60.1 kN wet, 32.1 kN dry. OPR 5.1, SFC 0.38/0.9 lb/lbf-hr static. Temperature limit Mach 3.0.

		#roRO-R15BDTitle = R-15BD-300 Turbojet
		#roRO-R15BDDesc = Late 50s turbojet. Originally developed for the Tu-121 cruise missile, the R-15 was modified instead for use on the MiG-25, which became the fastest serially produced fighter, capable of reaching Mach 3.2, although at the risk of severe engine damage. This is a later model, the BD-300, used on the MiG-25RB. Available 1969. 109.8kN wet, 86.3kN dry. OPR 4.75, SFC 1.25/2.75 lb/lbf-hr static. Temperature limit Mach 3.5.

		#roRO-R25FTitle = R-25-300 Turbojet
		#roRO-R25FDesc = Late 60s turbojet. Developed to replace the R-11 and R-13, the R-25 added an extremely powerful "extra-power" afterburner, that allowed it to nearly double it's thrust for short periods of time. This is the production model, used on the MiG-21Bis and Su-15Bis. 97.1kN wet, 40.3kN dry. OPR 9.5, SFC 0.96/3.34 lb/lbf-hr static. Temperature limit Mach 2.5.
		
		//		RD-9B
		#roRO-RD9BTitle = RD-9B Turbojet
		#roRO-RD9BDesc = Early 50s turbojet. Developed as a scaled down Mikulin AM-3, the RD-9 was designed for fighter aircraft, and powered the Yak-25, 26, 27, 28, and MiG-19.
