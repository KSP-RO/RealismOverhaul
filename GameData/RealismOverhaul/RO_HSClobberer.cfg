	// All-in-one parts (Vostok/Voskhod, etc.) shouldn't be excluded, so they actually die if you use up their Heat Shield
	// Parts with a small amount of Ablator as a occlusion work-around (Mercury, Gemini) should be excluded, they shouldn't need ablator and should be plenty durable without it
	// Stuff that has ablator but also a separate heat shield (Apollo) also excluded for now, if you manage to burn off all the ablator you'll probably burn through the skin too. May need to be changed in the future?
