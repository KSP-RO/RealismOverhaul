This method of construction does not have mechanically seperate tanks and frame, but the skin of the tank is only responsible for containing the propellant and is not load-bearing. The first rocket of skin-stringer-frame construction was the Soviet R-5 and has remained a staple of Russian design philosophy since, best exemplified in the very successful R-7 and Proton families.

Currently, the only rocket to use composite materials is the smallsat Electron orbital launcher developed by Rocket Lab.
