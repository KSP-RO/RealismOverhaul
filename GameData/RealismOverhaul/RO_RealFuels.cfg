Completely stir-welding a semi-stringer-constructed tank was first used by SpaceX on their Falcon 1e and then Falcon 9 series of rockets. This unique construction allows for the use of fewer structural components and lighter welds, resulting in both mass and cost reductions.

Although costs continue to drop, the intensive manufacturing process is still very expensive, requiring the wrapping and weaving of hundreds of layers of carbon fiber with resins that are then baked off in massive autoclaves. Currently, the only rocket to use composite materials is the smallsat Electron orbital launcher developed by Rocket Lab.

This combines tank and frame, but the skin of the tank is only responsible for containing the propellant and is not structural. The first rocket of this type of construction was the R-5 and skin-stringer-frame construction has remained a staple of Russian design philosophy, including the R-7 and Proton families. These are 35% (standard) or 20% (HP) lighter than Al fuselage tanks while costing 25% more to tool and 10% more once tooled.

Friction stir welding uses heat from the friction of rotating tool to soften and intermix two pieces of metal for very strong welds. A completely stir-welded tank was first used on the Falcon 1e and then on Falcon 9. This allows for fewer structural components and lighter welds, thus, cheaper and lighter tanks, especially at high pressures. These are 6% (standard) or 15% (HP) lighter than Al-Li stringer tanks while costing 20% less to tool and 15% less once tooled.

Isogrids and orthogrids are advanced hollowed-out structures milled out of a single block of material that have very high rigidity yet exceptional material and mass savings. The delicate & complex lattices on the panel require very high precision machining and thus such a construction is much more expensive to produce than more standard tanks. Nevertheless, gridded tanks have been utilized by nearly every NASA orbital vehicle since the very first to use gridded aluminum construction: the Thor/Delta and Titan rockets as well as the Agena upper stage.

If the pressurization fails, the balloon tank collapses. They are constructed of very thin sheets of stainless steel and have very good mass fractions, but the logistics involved in maintaining pressurization make them quite expensive. These early balloon tanks were first used by Atlas and the Centaur C upper stage.
