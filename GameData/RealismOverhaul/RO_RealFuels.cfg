The first rocket of skin-stringer-frame construction was the Soviet R-5 and has remained a staple of Russian design philosophy since, best exemplified in the very successful R-7 and Proton families.

Although costs continue to drop, the intensive manufacturing process is still very expensive, requiring the wrapping and weaving of hundreds of layers of carbon fiber with resins that are then baked off in massive autoclaves. Currently, the only rocket to use composite materials is the smallsat Electron orbital launcher developed by Rocket Lab.
