{
    @description = The most basic form of fuel tank. Conventional structure tanks consist of two parts, a support structure (also known as stringers) and a fuel tank. Earlier iterations also had a separate skin surrounding them, but later tanks moved the structure inside the fuel tanks. This makes them cheap and easy to produce.

    @description = A very expensive and fragile, but also very light tank. Balloon tanks are expensive and complex as they need to be pressurized at all times, but they are much lighter than regular tanks. These are similar to tanks used on the Atlas and Centaur stages. <b><color=green>Min Utilization: 99% - Max Utilization: 100%</color></b>
