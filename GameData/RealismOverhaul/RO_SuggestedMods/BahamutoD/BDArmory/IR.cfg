	@description = An early 1960s infrared search and track system. Installed underneath the nose of the F-4B, the AN/AAA-4 was designed to detect high-flying, supersonic targets. However, the performance in service was poor, and it was deleted from most F-4 variants to make room for electronic countermeasures or an internal cannon.
