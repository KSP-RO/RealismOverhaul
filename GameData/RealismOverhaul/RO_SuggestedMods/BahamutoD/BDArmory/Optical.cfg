	@description = A late 1960s target designation pod. Developed to replace the Airborne Laser Designator (ALD), a handheld laser designator that pilots would need to use to manually designate their target, the AN/AVQ-10 Pave Knife pod featured a TV camera with low-light capabilities mated to a laser designator, greatly increasing the accuracy of laser-guided weapons.
