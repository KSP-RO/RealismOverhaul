//Generally radar performance is given as a range against a target of a certain RCS, and a maximum
//instrumented range. To turn this into a reasonable float curve, we can use a simplified version of the 
//radar range equation: range = (radar properties * RCS)^1/4
//Although we don't know the radar properties, we can assume they stay constant (somewhat safe, many radars
//have multiple search modes which will alter these properties), and therefore determine the radar-specific
//"performance constant" based on one point of data. From there, we can work backwards and find RCS
//values for any other range (and tangents).

//non-pulse doppler radars have much better look-down performance than they should
//BDB look-down penalties for radar are not very aggressive, generally about 20%-50% at typical angles.
//Since we're using realistic radar curves, reducing RCS by 50% only reduces range by about 15%.
