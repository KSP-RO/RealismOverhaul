	@manufacturer = Lockheed
	@description = The Strawman Bus is intended to push Agena-based satellites' life and capabilities to their full potential. Not only does this bus expand the Agena's profile from 0.9375m to 1.25m, it also introduces redundant systems, intregated batteries, a built-in fairing, and a new state-of-the-art solid-state data recording system. This sytem is  While intended to be a platform for singals intelligence reconnaissance collection, this bus can be used for any number of applications with the Agena upper stage and beyond.
