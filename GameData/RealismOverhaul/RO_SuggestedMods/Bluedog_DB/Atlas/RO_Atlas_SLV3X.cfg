	@manufacturer = #roMrfConvair
	@description = Lower adapter fuel tank for early XB-65 Atlas concepts. Has a mounting point for a single sustainer and allows the use of a 4m jettisonable booster skirt supporting 4 engines. The extremely thin walls of this tank are kept in tension by the pressure of the fuel (and pressurant gas as the fuel is used), providing a rigidity similar to a soda can. While extremely resilient, it cannot have other components radially attached to it, as doing so would compromise the structural integrity.

	@manufacturer = #roMrfConvair
	@description = Main fuel tank for the 4m Atlas SLV-3X launcher. You'll need to attach the adapter tank on to the bottom before mounting the aft sections. The extremely thin walls of this tank are kept in tension by the pressure of the fuel (and pressurant gas as the fuel is used), providing a rigidity similar to a soda can.
