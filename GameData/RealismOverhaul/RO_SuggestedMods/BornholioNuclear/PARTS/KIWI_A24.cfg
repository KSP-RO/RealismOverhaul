	@description = The "KIWI A" series is an older 132MW reactor with the lowest power density of all the rover tests. Most tests resulted in failure with shattered fuel elements or faulted test equipment however much was learned and the development of liquid hydrogen pumping is a major accomplishment. Its core is capable of starting up twice.  An integral Tungsten shield is included and the whole assembly is regeneratively cooled. A secondary circuit runs the shutdown gasses through a small heat engine to minimize fuel loss and provide basic alternator power. This engine should be mounted two to six meters from the closest fuel tank.  Fuel should shield any crew and crew positions when running should be six to nine meters from the engine. Additional shielding such as a water tank or high density fuel can somewhat reduce this amount. All subsequent US nuclear thermal rocket designs build off this concept. This version features a very small fixed regeneratively cooled nozzle with a 24:1 area expansion ratio. Nozzle Ae/A*=24   Chamber Temp=2300   Ideal ISP=874  Reactor Power=132MW(th)  TWR=0.24   Chamber Pressure=1415kPa   Ignitions =2   Tonnage including integral shadow shield: 12.08tons
