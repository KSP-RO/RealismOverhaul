	@description = The "KIWI B" series is an older 1100MW reactor with more than 10 times the power density of the A series. Most tests early resulted in failure with shattered fuel elements or faulted test equipment however much was learned and the development of advanced coatings chemical vapour deposition and heat pipes. The final test B4E ran smoothly and even restarted from a cold condition. The first Kiwi B test was run on gaseous hydrogen since hydrogen pumping and storage was in its infancy. Its core is capable of starting up four times.  An integral Tungsten shield is included and the whole assembly is regeneratively cooled. A secondary circuit runs the shut down gasses through a small heat engine to minimize fuel loss and provide basic alternator power. This engine should be mounted three to six meters from the closest fuel tank.  Fuel should shield any crew and crew positions when running should be eight to twelve meters from the engine. Additional shielding such as a water tank or high density fuel can somewhat reduce this amount. This rocket represents the basic and conservative solid core rocket design. The NERVA designs build off this concept. This version features a fixed regeneratively cooled nozzle with a 66:1 expansion ratio.  Nozzle Ae=66   Chamber Temp=2473   Ideal ISP=864  Reactor Power=1166MW(th)  TWR=2.04   Chamber Pressure=3606kPa   Ignitions =4   Tonnage including integral shadow shield:13.76tons
