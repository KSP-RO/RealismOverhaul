	@description = The "Nerva XE" series is a 1550MW reactor. A full flight test prototype originally based on the KIWI B4E. Its core is capable of starting up sixty times.  An integral Tungsten Boron composite shield is included and the whole assembly is regeneratively cooled. A secondary circuit runs the shut down gasses through a small heat engine to minimize fuel loss and provide basic alternator power. This engine should be mounted three to six meters from the closest fuel tank.  Fuel should shield any crew and crew positions when running should be eight to ten meters from the engine. Additional shielding such as a water tank or high density fuel can somewhat reduce this amount. This rocket represents the beginnings of a more powerful and capable series of rocket. This version features a fixed regeneratively cooled nozzle with a 100:1 expansion ratio. Nozzle Ae=100   Chamber Temp=2500   Ideal ISP=945  Reactor Power=1163MW(th)  TWR=2.34   Chamber Pressure=3806kPa   Ignitions =60   Tonnage including integral shadow shield: 10.38tons
