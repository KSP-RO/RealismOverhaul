	@description = The "PEWEE" series is a smaller 572MW reactor with the highest power density of all the rover tests. It also recorded the Highest ISP ratings of the test at 901s. Its core is capable of starting up to 12 times.  An integral Tungsten Boron Composite shield is included and the whole assembly is regeneratively cooled. A secondary circuit runs the shutdown gasses through a small heat engine to minimize fuel loss and provide basic alternator power. This engine should be mounted three to six meters from the closest fuel tank.  Fuel should shield any crew and crew positions when running should be nine to twelve meters from the engine. Additional shielding such as a water tank or high density fuel can somewhat reduce this amount. Most modern NASA study reactors such as the BNTR are derived in turn from this test reactor. This version features a fixed regeneratively cooled nozzle. Nozzle Ae=100   Chamber Temp=2750   Ideal ISP=998  Reactor Power=572MW(th)  TWR=5.07   Chamber Pressure=4344kPa   Ignitions =12   Tonnage including integral shadow shield: 2.23tons
