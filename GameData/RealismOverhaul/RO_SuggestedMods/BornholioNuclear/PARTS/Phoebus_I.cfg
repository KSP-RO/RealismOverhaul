	@description = The "Phoebus 1" series is a 1500MW reactor. Most tests early resulted in failure from pumping or faulted test equipment however much was learned and the development of advanced coatings chemical vapour deposition and lighter materials. Its core is capable of starting up four times.  An integral Tungsten Boron composite shield is included and the whole assembly is regeneratively cooled. A secondary circuit runs the shut down gasses through a small heat engine to minimize fuel loss and provide basic alternator power. This engine should be mounted three to six meters from the closest fuel tank.  Fuel should shield any crew and crew positions when running should be eight to twelve meters from the engine. Additional shielding such as a water tank or high density fuel can somewhat reduce this amount. This rocket represents the beginnings of a more powerful and capable series of rocket. This version features a fixed regeneratively cooled nozzle with a 50:1 expansion ratio. Nozzle Ae=50   Chamber Temp=2255   Ideal ISP=881  Reactor Power=1500MW(th)  TWR=3.33   Chamber Pressure=3772kPa   Ignitions =4   Tonnage including integral shadow shield: 9.14tons
