	@description = The "Phoebus 2" series is a 5000MW reactor. Most tests resulted in success proving new coatings worked well and existing at the time as the most powerful reactor core on the planet. Its core is capable of starting up eight times.  An integral Tungsten Boron composite shield is included and the whole assembly is regeneratively cooled. A secondary circuit runs the shut down gasses through a small heat engine to minimize fuel loss and provide basic alternator power. This engine should be mounted three to six meters from the closest fuel tank.  Fuel should shield any crew and crew positions when running should be ten to fifteen meters from the engine. Additional shielding such as a water tank or high density fuel can somewhat reduce this amount. This rocket represents a more powerful and capable series of rocket with a TWR of nearly 6. This version features a fixed regeneratively cooled nozzle with a 100:1 expansion ratio. Nozzle Ae=100   Chamber Temp=2245   Ideal ISP=889  Reactor Power=4182MW(th)  TWR=5.48   Chamber Pressure=3825kPa   Ignitions =8   Tonnage including integral shadow shield: 16.97tons
