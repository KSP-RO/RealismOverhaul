	@description = RD-0410 was a Soviet nuclear thermal rocket engine developed from 1965 through the 1994 using liquid hydrogen propellant. The engine was ground-tested at the Semipalatinsk Test Site, and its use was incorporated in the Kurchatov Mars 1994 manned mission proposal. Its moderator and fuel are quite different from the US designs and Metal Carbide (MC) versions of the fuel are rumoured to have reach as high as 3500K without melting in the early 1990's. Use of Heptane to reduce hydrogen corrosion of the carbides was critical to function (~1%). First run tests occurred in 1985. Some Russian sources list it as dual mode using not only Hydrogen but also liquid Methane without additives. During the SNTP program the US tried to acquire MC fuels from Russian sources but planned purchases fell through. This engine is very heavily built compared to US designs and incorporates a four lobed spiral fuel rod to eliminate risk of fuel being ejected if the rods shattered. This design uses a short regeneratively cooled nozzle and is intended as an upper stage. Design stats Nozzle Ae=46   Chamber Temp=2700   Ideal ISP=972  Reactor Power=173MW(th)  TWR=1.73   Chamber Pressure=4000kPa   Ignitions =10   Tonnage including integral shadow shield:2tons.  In Methane mode the nozzle is slightly expanded by 12cm length and slightly enlarged.
