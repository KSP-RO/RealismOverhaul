	@description = The "SNTP-PFE" series is a 1000MW reactor. The reactor is a particle bed using metallic carbide coated uranium granules embedded in a graphite rod that hydrogen is passed through. This allows for power densities of up to 40MW/liter. Its core is capable of starting up five times.  An integral Tungsten Boron Lithium Hydride composite shield is included and the whole assembly is regeneratively cooled. A secondary circuit runs the shut down gasses through a small heat engine to minimize fuel loss and provide basic alternator power. This engine should be mounted three to six meters from the closest fuel tank.  Fuel should shield any crew and crew positions when running should be ten to fifteen meters from the engine. Additional shielding such as a water tank or high density fuel can somewhat reduce this amount. This rocket has impressive stats for its size (Nozzle Ae=100   Chamber Temp=2720   Ideal ISP=991  Reactor Power=1054MW(th)  TWR=13.94   Chamber Pressure=6800kPa   Ignitions =5   Tonnage including integral shadow shield:1.504tons ) The nozzle is a fixed ablatively cooled filament wound carbon-carbon design.
