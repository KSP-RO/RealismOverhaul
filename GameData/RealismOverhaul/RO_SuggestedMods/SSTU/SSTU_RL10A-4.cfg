	@title = RL10A-4 Series Vacuum Engine
	%manufacturer = Pratt & Whitney
	@description = Hydrolox restartable expander-cycle vacuum engine used in countless applications. Most famous applications include the Centaur upper stage, the S-IV upper stage of the original Saturn I launcher, and the new Delta Cryogenic Second Stage. The RL10 uses liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen (so beware of boiloff); it has very low thrust, but very high specific impulse, and is designed for beyond-Low-Earth-Orbit applications like launching satellites to geostationary transfer orbits or to the Moon or other planets. However, like all cryogenic engines, boiloff is a serious issue without heat pumps or radiators. Mount size can be adjusted from 1.25m to 10m in 1m increments. Diameter: [1.25 m].
