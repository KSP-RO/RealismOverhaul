title = Rockomax HubMax Multi-Point Connector (4M)
manufacturer = Rockomax Brand
description = When it was unveiled at the 3rd annual Rockets & Explosions festival, the HubMax Multi-Point Connector caused several patrons to die of shock on the spot. 'All my life I thought rocket parts could be placed one way - up! But Rockomax today has shattered that notion' said one survivor, who asked to remain anonymous. Needless to say, this part may very well herald a revolution in construction technologies. Docking ports sold separately.  Now in 4 meter size!
